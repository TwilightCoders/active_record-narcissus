# ActiveRecord::Narcissus

`ActiveRecord::Narcissus` lends a helping hand to `ActiveRecord` when it comes to reflecting on the correct class for associations, particularly `:through` associations. See [usage](#usage) bellow for more details.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'active_record-narcissus'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_record-narcissus

## Usage

ActiveRecord::Narcissus will automatically engage when ActiveRecord is loaded.

It works by slightly modifying the way ActiveRecord reflects on associations, particularly `:through` associations. Ths allows for the following to work automatically.

```ruby

Widget = Class.new(ActiveRecord::Base)

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # These will be of type User::Widget by default based on namespacing
  has_many :widgets 
end


class User
  class Widget < ::Widget
    self.table_name = "user_widgets"
    belongs_to :user
  end
end

class Post
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :user_widgets, through: :user, source: :widgets
end
```
